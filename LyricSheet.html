			<h2> by Car Seat Headrest</h2>
			
			<p> Intro</p>
			<p> In the backseat of my heart </p>
			<p> My love tells me I'm a mess </p>
			<p> I couldn't get the car to start </p>
			<p> I left my keys somewhere in the mess </p>
			
			<p> Verse 1 </p>
			<p> It comes and goes in plateaus </p>
			<p> One month later, I'm a fucking pro </p>
			<p> My parents would be proud </p>
			<p> Or fall asleep on the floor </p>
			<p> Forget what happened in the morning </p>
			<p> There are notes in your handwriting </p>
			<p> But you can't make it out </p>
			
			<p> Chorus 1 </p>
			<p> We are not a proud race </p>
			<p> It's not a race at all </p>
			<p> We're just trying </p>
			<p> I'm only trying to get home</p>
			<p> Drunk drivers, drunk drivers </p>
			<p> This is not a good thing </p>
			<p> I don't mean to rationalize </p>
			<p> Or try and explain it away </p>
			<p> It's not okay </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers, drunk drivers </p>

			<p> Verse 1 </p>
			<p> It's too late to articulate it </p>
			<p> That empty feeling </p>
			<p> You share the same fate as the people you hate </p>
			<p> You build yourself up against others' feelings </p>
			<p> And it left you feeling empty as a car coasting downhill </p>
			<p> I have become such a negative person </p>
			<p> It was all just an act </p>
			<p> It was all so easily stripped away </p>

			<p> Pre-Chorus </p>
			<p> But if we learn how to live like this </p>
			<p> Maybe we can learn how to start again </p>
			<p> Like a child who's never done wrong </p>
			<p> Who hasn't taken that first step </p>

			
			<p> Chorus 2 </p>
			<p> We are not a proud race </p>
			<p> It's not a race at all </p>
			<p> We're just trying </p>
			<p> I'm only trying to get home</p>
			<p> Drunk drivers, drunk drivers </p>
			<p> Put it out of your mind </p>
			<p> And perish the thought </p>
			<p> There's no comfort in responsibility </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers, drunk drivers </p>

			<p> Chorus 3 </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> Killer whales, killer whales </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> Killer whales, killer whales </p>

			<p> Verse 3 </p>
			<p> Here's that voice in your head </p>
			<p> Giving you shit again </p>
			<p> But you know he loves you </p>
			<p> And he doesn't mean to cause you pain </p>
			<p> Please listen to him </p>
			<p> It's not too late </p>
			<p> Turn off the engine </p>
			<p> Get out of the car </p>
			<p> And start to walk </p>

			<p> Bridge </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers </p>
			<p> Drunk drivers </p>

			<p> Chorus 3 </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> Killer whales, killer whales </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> It doesn't have to be like this </p>
			<p> Killer whales, killer whales </p>

			<p> Outro </p>
			<p> Ahhh </p>
			<p> Whales...ahhh </p>
			<p> Whales...ahhh yeah yeah...</p>
			<p> Whales...oh oh oh oh oh </p>
